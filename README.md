##Your Shiny Application

The application must include the following:

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
5. The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.
